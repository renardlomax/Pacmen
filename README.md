# Pacmen Exercise
This was my first MIT coding project from Mit edx pro coding bootcamp. I created a pacman game where i implemented functional code  I was given the task of creating the pacman image to bounce along the webpage without going off the screeen. I was able to create a functional tab to to start the game and add additional pacmen. 
## How to get started
Clone/Download Files
#

## What I plan on improving
- I plan on making more than one image that moves in the game.
- Would also like to different pacmen images that change color when hit the walls.
